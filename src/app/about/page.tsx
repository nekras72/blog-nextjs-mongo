                I'm Ilia Nekrasov, a passionate Fullstack Developer with over five years of hands-on experience in crafting web solutions. My journey in the tech world began with a strong educational foundation, earning a Master's Degree in Applied Math and Computer Science from Tyumen State Industrial University in Russia. Seeking new challenges and opportunities, I moved to Israel and further honed my skills through a specialized Java & Web Developer program at Tel-Ran Computing Solution Ltd.

                My professional career kicked off in Russia, where I worked as a Frontend Web Developer at Business Promotion. There, I maintained and developed Instagram-related web applications, transforming legacy codebases with modern technologies. This role ignited my love for frontend development and set the stage for my future endeavors.

                In 2019, I joined Optisor LTD in Rehovot, Israel, as a Frontend Web Developer. I delved into creating dynamic web applications, including SPAs and online shops, while mastering the full project lifecycleâ€”from inception to deployment and maintenance. My work here involved SEO optimization, backend data synchronization, and the integration of various services like payment systems, analytics, and social media.

                Currently, I am a Fullstack Web Developer at Gini-apps LTD in Herzliya, Israel. At Gini-apps, I develop SDK web components using vanilla JavaScript and build robust SPAs with React 18 and TypeScript. I've had the opportunity to work on audio/video applications and integrate essential services like mParticle, Braze, Twilio, and MailChimp.

                Throughout my career, I've embraced a diverse tech stack, including ReactJS, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and various databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. I thrive in environments that utilize CI/CD practices with tools like CircleCI and GitHub Actions and enjoy exploring new frameworks and libraries to enhance my development process.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and keeping up with industry trends. As I plan my move to the center of Israel this fall, I'm excited about the new opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.

            <p>
                This blog initially started as a simple addition to my portfolio. However, one day in the shower (where all the best ideas seem to come to mind), I realized I wanted to create something truly useful, at least for myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's when the idea struck to transform this blog into a dynamic cheat sheet, one that could always be expanded and updated. There was a significant amount of work ahead. But if you're reading this, it means I completed the task.
